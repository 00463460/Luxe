Q: What are the best summer perfumes?
A: Our summer collection includes Fresh Citrus Bliss (citrus and lemon notes), Ocean Breeze Essence (aquatic with coconut), and Tropical Paradise (floral and fruity). These are light, fresh fragrances perfect for warm weather.

Q: What does "Eau de Parfum" mean?
A: Eau de Parfum (EDP) is a fragrance concentration with 15-20% pure fragrance oils. It's stronger and lasts longer than Eau de Toilette (EDT), making it ideal for all-day wear.

Q: How long does a perfume last?

Q: Do you have sample sizes?
A: Yes! All perfumes come in 5ml sample sizes so you can try before committing to a full 100ml bottle.

Q: What's the difference between floral and woody scents?
A: Floral scents feature flower notes (rose, jasmine, lily) and are typically romantic and sweet. Woody scents use wood notes (sandalwood, cedar) and are earthy, warm, and masculine.

Q: Can I layer perfumes?
A: Yes! You can layer complementary scents. Start with a light scent as your base and add a stronger one on top. Test combinations first.

Q: How should I store my perfume?
A: Store in a cool, dark place away from direct sunlight and heat. Keep the cap tightly closed to prevent evaporation.

Q: What are fragrance notes?
A: Fragrances have three types of notes: Top notes (initial fresh scent that fades in 5-15 mins), Heart/Middle notes (main scent lasting 20 mins to hours), and Base notes (foundation that lasts longest).
